# TripToCost

Static site — plain HTML/CSS/JS, no build step, no backend, no dependencies to install.

## Open in VS Code

```
code "C:\Users\pc\OneDrive\wander-list"
```

## Run it locally

**Option A — Live Server extension (recommended)**
1. Install the "Live Server" extension (VS Code will prompt you via the recommendation, or search `ritwickdey.LiveServer` in the Extensions panel).
2. Right-click [index.html](index.html) → **Open with Live Server**.
3. It opens at `http://127.0.0.1:3000` and auto-reloads on save.

**Option B — terminal**
```
npm start
```
Serves the folder at `http://localhost:3000` (uses `npx serve`, no install needed — requires Node.js).

Don't open pages directly via `file://` (double-clicking the file) — always serve them over `http://` (Option A or B above). Some browsers handle script timing and lazy-loading differently over `file://`.

## Going live

### 1. Pick a host

This is a plain static site, so any static host works. Simplest options:

- **Vercel** — `vercel deploy` from this folder, or connect the Git repo. A [vercel.json](vercel.json) is already included (security headers + sane CSS/JS caching).
- **Netlify** — drag the whole folder onto [app.netlify.com/drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop), or connect the Git repo for auto-deploys on push. A [netlify.toml](netlify.toml) is also included for the same headers/caching if you deploy there instead.
- **GitHub Pages** — push to a repo, enable Pages on the `main` branch.

All three (and most other static hosts) automatically serve [404.html](404.html) for any unmatched URL — no extra configuration needed.

### 2. Domain

Canonical URLs, Open Graph/Twitter tags, `robots.txt`, and `sitemap.xml` are already set to `www.triptocost.com`. If that ever needs to change again, `scripts/set-domain.js` does it in one command:

```bash
node scripts/set-domain.js www.your-real-domain.com
```

(The script also accepts a second, optional email argument, left over from when there was a contact page — harmless to omit now.)

The email argument is optional. The script reports exactly how many occurrences it changed and in how many files, so you can sanity-check the count.

### 3. Pre-launch checklist

- [ ] Social links in the footer (currently `#`) pointed at real accounts, or removed
- [ ] Read through [privacy-policy.html](privacy-policy.html) and [terms.html](terms.html) — they're a reasonable starting scaffold, not legal advice; have them reviewed before relying on them
- [ ] Submit `sitemap.xml` to Google Search Console / Bing Webmaster Tools once the domain is live

## Structure

**Pages**
- [index.html](index.html) — homepage (hero, category browse, featured carousel, 3D globe, testimonials)
- [browse.html](browse.html) — full itinerary listing with style/budget/text filters
- [saved-trips.html](saved-trips.html) — renders whatever's saved in the visitor's browser (see Sessions below)
- 39 itinerary pages spanning beach/coastal, mountain, historic-city, modern-city, road-trip, and lakes/nature styles across Europe, Asia, and North America — e.g. [itinerary.html](itinerary.html) (Tokyo & Kyoto), [amalfi-coast.html](amalfi-coast.html), [utah-national-parks.html](utah-national-parks.html), [paris.html](paris.html), [thailand.html](thailand.html); the full list is in [browse.html](browse.html) or the `TRIP_CATALOG` object in [js/main.js](js/main.js)
- [about.html](about.html), [how-it-works.html](how-it-works.html)
- [privacy-policy.html](privacy-policy.html), [terms.html](terms.html)
- [404.html](404.html) — custom not-found page with a working search box

**Code**
- [css/style.css](css/style.css) — design system + styles
- [js/main.js](js/main.js) — all interactivity, animation, filtering, and session persistence
- [js/globe.js](js/globe.js) — the homepage's 3D globe (Three.js, loaded as an ES module from a CDN)

**SEO**
- [robots.txt](robots.txt), [sitemap.xml](sitemap.xml)
- Every page has a unique meta description, canonical tag, Open Graph + Twitter Card tags
- BreadcrumbList structured data (JSON-LD) on every page with a breadcrumb; FAQPage schema on How It Works

## Sessions (no account needed)

Two things persist per-browser via `localStorage`, with no login required:

- **Saved trips** — the ♥ button on any itinerary page saves it to `saved-trips.html`. Stored under the `wanderlist_saved_trips` key.
- **Packing checklist progress** — checked items persist per-trip, keyed by page filename (e.g. `wanderlist_packing_paris.html`).

This is intentionally device/browser-local, not account-based — clearing site data or switching browsers resets it. See [privacy-policy.html](privacy-policy.html) for the plain-language explanation shown to visitors.

## Shared reviews (optional backend)

Reviews on the home page are shared between visitors through `api/reviews.js`, a dependency-free Vercel serverless function that stores them in an Upstash Redis database over its REST API.

Setup (one time, in the Vercel dashboard):

1. Project > Storage > Create Database > **Upstash for Redis**, and connect it to this project. Vercel adds `KV_REST_API_URL` and `KV_REST_API_TOKEN` (or `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` and `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN`) automatically.
2. Optional: add an environment variable `REVIEWS_ADMIN_TOKEN` (any long random string) to be able to remove a review: `curl -X DELETE "https://www.triptocost.com/api/reviews?id=REVIEW_ID" -H "x-admin-token: YOUR_TOKEN"` (the id is in the JSON returned by `GET /api/reviews`).
3. Redeploy.

Until a database is connected the function answers `{ "configured": false }` and the site falls back to the old behaviour (reviews stay in the visitor's own browser).
